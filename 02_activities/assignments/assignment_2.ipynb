    "Instead of iterating over the list, one can use a 'set' data structure to represent the range of values. By performing a set difference operation, the function can achieve the same results. This approach may offer slightly improved performance for smaller lists of numbers. However, it's important to note that the resulting output will not be sorted. If an unsorted output is acceptable, this solution can be effective. Sorting the result of the set difference operation would sacrifice the efficiency gained in using the set.\n",

    "For Assignment 1, my task was to implement a function that generates all root-to-leaf paths in a tree. This involved developing a method using Depth-First Search (DFS) and returned paths in list of lists format. Firstly, I defined a TreeNode class that represented nodes in a tree. Each node could have multiple children, allowing for a flexible tree structure. The desired method within TreeNode class used recursive DFS to explore the tree from the root node down to each leaf node. During traversal, I collected paths by appending node values to a path list until a leaf node was reached, at which point the complete path was added to the paths list.  I tested the method with different tree configurations including balanced and unbalanced trees. An alternate method using Breadth-First Search approach using a queue was also proposed. This exercise enhanced my understanding of recursive algorithms and tree traversal techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Assignment 2, I performed code review of Zarrin's implementation for finding missing numbers within a specified range [0, n], i.e, reviewing a function that identifies and returns missing numbers from a list, considering duplicates. I reviewed the code for performance optimizations, edge case handling, and adherence to problem requirements. I used timeit function to measure the function's execution time for different input sizes, ensuring it operated efficiently. I provided constructive feedback on handling edge cases like empty lists or duplicates, and ensuring the function's output met expected results. I proposed a solution which could be potentially faster. For both the assignments, the Big(O) notation for time and space complexity analysis was also performed. "
